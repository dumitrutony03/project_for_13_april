# project_for_13_april

This was a challenge for myself.
I had the opportunity to be selected for a Flutter Framework training, held by ARRK R&D, from Cluj-Napoca.

After 2 weeks and 6 meetings, we had to get an app on our own, so I did it.

This is an Android Based Application, made exclusively using Flutter Framework, Android Studio, and Firebase. 

App content: 

- Sign Up and Login pages, with validations

- Page where you add the CAR OBJECT details: Name, Model, Color, Year, Price and Photo ( This is a link you have to paste, from outside the app, 
  * EXAMPLE *: https://scene7.toyota.eu/is/image/toyotaeurope/LAN0007b_21:Large-Landscape?ts=19457&resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.75,0.3,2,0 ).
  
- The OBJECT will then be saved in the database, in Firebase.
  
- Filtering ( Search bar where you can type THE CAR NAME you want to be shown to you ) and Favorite Adding Car/Cars,
 
- Fresh UI with suggestively named fields,
 
I am grateful that i had this opportunity, and I worked very hard, being the best version of myself.
